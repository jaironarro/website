      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the Cleveland Clinic - UTEC Challenge 2022, we proposed the design of a  microfluidic sensor that integrates the CRISPR/Cas13 system for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. The microfluidic device consists of three modules: RNA extraction (1), RNA elution (2) and CRISPR reaction (3). If the pathogen is present, the cas13 collateral cleavage function will be activated, and the reporters will release a fluorescent signal that can be measured with a mobile app. This low-cost and easy-to-handle diagnostic platform can be implemented in remote areas with medical centers that do not have adequate infrastructure or equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Droplet formation is an important process for different types of biological analysis. In this work, a water-in-oil droplet-generating microfluidic device was designed, fabricated and tested. The microfluidic chip was fabricated by stereolithography 3D printing and its performance was evaluated using syringe pumps. For more information about the project, please refer to the &amp;lsquo;PDF&amp;rsquo; button above.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, I designed a CAD model in Onshape of a microfluidic droplet-generating device based on the article &amp;ldquo;High-throughput detection of ethanol-producing-cyanobacteria in a microdroplet platform&amp;rdquo;. The objective of the paper was to develop a quantitative ethanol detection method on a microdroplet-based platform to detect cyanobacterial strains and identify those with the highest levels of ethanol productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
